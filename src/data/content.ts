    content: `# Training AI on Copyrighted Works: Fair Dealing in India?

> *Abstract:* This explainer maps Indian fair dealing (s.52, Copyright Act) against US fair use tests, recent UK/EU trends, and practical guidance for rights holders and AI developers.

## Key Takeaways
1. No general fair use in India; *fair dealing* applies to limited purposes.
2. Database rights differ; scraping cases abroad are persuasive, not binding.
3. Contracts and TPMs often decide the outcome.

### Recent Developments
The intersection of AI training and copyright law presents unique challenges in the Indian context. Unlike the US fair use doctrine, Indian copyright law operates under a more restrictive fair dealing framework.

### Legal Framework
Section 52 of the Copyright Act, 1957 provides specific exceptions, including:
- Research and private study
- Criticism or review
- Reporting current events

### International Perspective
Recent decisions in the UK and EU suggest a more nuanced approach to AI training data, with courts considering:
- Purpose and character of use
- Nature of copyrighted work
- Amount used
- Effect on market value

Courts distinguish debt due from debt payable at admission.

> *Case Law Callout:* Key paras from recent judgments will be added here.

## The Due vs Payable Distinction
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 creates an important distinction between debt that is "due" and debt that is "payable."

### NCLT Interpretations
Recent National Company Law Tribunal decisions have clarified that:
- Due debt may not always be immediately payable
- Future obligations require careful analysis
- Contingent liabilities need specific treatment

### Practical Implications
This distinction significantly affects:
- Admission criteria under Section 7
- Creditor rights and remedies
- Timeline for CIRP initiation`
